# AWS_API_DATA_ENDPOINT
- The script starts by importing necessary Python libraries:  
  - `json` for handling JSON data.  
  - `requests` for making API requests.  
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.  

- It defines two key variables:  
  - `API_ENDPOINT`: Placeholder for the API URL that will be used to fetch data.  
  - `BEARER_TOKEN`: Placeholder for the authentication token required to access the API.  

- A dictionary named `COLUMN_MAPPING` is created to define column name transformations for a DataFrame.  
  - Some column mappings are commented out, indicating that only specific columns will be renamed.  

- The function `lambda_handler(event, context)` is defined, which is structured to be used in an AWS Lambda function.  

- Inside the function:  
  - The `headers` dictionary is set up with authentication and content type information.  
  - A GET request is sent to the API using `requests.get(API_ENDPOINT, headers=headers)`.  

- The script prints the response status code and body for debugging purposes.  

- It checks if the API request was successful (status code 200).  
  - If not, it returns an error message in JSON format, including the response details.  

- If the API response is successful:  
  - The JSON response is converted into a pandas DataFrame using `pd.DataFrame(data)`.  
  - The DataFrame columns are renamed using the predefined `COLUMN_MAPPING` dictionary.  

- The DataFrame is then converted into a JSON-formatted string with a "records" orientation, meaning each row is represented as a JSON object.  

- The function returns a JSON response with:  
  - HTTP status code `200` indicating success.  
  - A header specifying the content type as JSON.  
  - The processed JSON data as the response body.  

- If any errors occur during execution, the function catches the exception and returns an HTTP status code `500` with an error message containing the exception details.
